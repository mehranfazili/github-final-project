# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information without permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate.

## Scope
This Code applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers at **maintainers@nowhere.example**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines when determining consequences:

1. **Correction** — Private, written warning; clarification of expectations.  
2. **Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behavior.  
3. **Temporary Ban** — Temporary removal from the community.  
4. **Permanent Ban** — Permanent removal from the community.
